Absolutely — here’s a **professional, clean, and developer-friendly `README.md`** for your Ecommerce Flutter app using **TDD + Clean Architecture**:

---

## 🛍️ Ecommerce Flutter App

A modern Flutter-based Ecommerce application built using **Clean Architecture** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. It showcases best practices in structuring large-scale apps, writing maintainable and testable code, and integrating remote/local data sources using `http` and `shared_preferences`.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 🛒 View all products (from remote API)
* 🔍 View single product details
* ✍️ Create, update, and delete products
* 🌐 Remote data source using REST API (`http`)
* 💾 Local data source caching (`shared_preferences`)
* ✅ Full unit test coverage for data layer
* 🧪 Built with TDD workflow
* 🧼 Follows Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns (Data, Domain, Presentation)

---

### 🧱 Architecture

```
lib/
├── core/                     # Reusable core logic (exceptions, constants)
├── features/
│   └── product/
│       ├── data/             # Data layer (models, datasources, repositories)
│       ├── domain/           # Domain layer (entities, repositories, use cases)
│       └── presentation/     # UI and state management (optional)
```

### 📦 Dependencies

| Package              | Usage                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `http`               | Remote API communication       |
| `shared_preferences` | Local data caching             |
| `flutter_test`       | Unit testing                   |
| `mockito`            | Mocking dependencies in tests  |
| `dartz` *(optional)* | Functional programming helpers |

---

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

> ✅ All business logic is test-first using **TDD**.
> ✅ Local and remote data sources are fully covered with unit tests.

* **Mocks** are written manually (no `build_runner` used).
* **Test coverage includes:**

  * Remote API success and failure cases
  * Local caching and retrieval
  * Repository integration with both sources

---

### 🧰 How to Run the App

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

3. **Run app**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

---

### 📂 Example Test Command Output

```bash
+ fetchAllProducts returns correct data
+ fetchAllProducts throws ServerException on failure
+ cacheProducts stores JSON locally
+ getCachedProducts returns decoded models
```
